# Project Hydra: System Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture for Project Hydra. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and resilient.

## Core Components

The system consists of three primary services:

* **Ingestion Service**: Responsible for receiving and validating incoming data streams.
* **Processing Engine**: Handles data transformation and enrichment.
* **API Gateway**: Exposes processed data to client applications.

## Technology Stack

Our stack is built on modern, cloud-native technologies to ensure high availability and performance.

| Category  | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend  | React      |
| Backend   | Node.js    |
| Database  | PostgreSQL |
| Cloud     | Cloudinary |

> The choice of Cloudinary for media management allows us to handle image and video transformations on the fly, reducing the need for pre-processing and storage of multiple asset versions.

Here is a code sample for a basic server setup:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hydra API is running!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
